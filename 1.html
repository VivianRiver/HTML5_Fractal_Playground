    <h1>HTML5 Fractal Playground 1.1, April 6, 2014</h1>
    <p>
        Last month, I wrote about a new personal open-source project that I just put out called "HTML5 Fractal Playground".  In the intervening days, I have had time to tinker 
        with the program some more and I've added some features that will be important for anyone who wants to use the program to learn about fractals.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I fixed a bug that prevented Firefox's asm.js from properly optimizing the speed of the computations whenever the size of the plot
            is not a power of two.
        </li>
        <li>
            I added an HTML5 progress widget that displays the progress of performing the computations so that the user isn't staring at a blank
            plot while waiting for long-running computations to take place.
        </li>
        <li>
            I added an option to allow the maximum number of iterations to compute to increase as you zoom in on the fractal.  This is probably
            the single best thing I've added because it allows you to easily zoom in and see much more detail than you normally would in the
            first version.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finally, I completely revamped the way that colors are chosen to correspond with different escape iterations.  In the first version,
            any point that escaped in one iteration was black, and any point that more than about 50 iterations to escape was bright blue, and
            any point inside the fractal was black.  In the new version, the colors are chosen so that they are relative to the maximum and
            minimum number of iterations to escape found for the chosen coordinates.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        I think that I have the functionality to draw the fractals working very well, and so for the next version, I would like to improve
        the user interface.  I like that I have written this so that the user can modify the code that computes the fractal, but I do
        recognize that this is too advanced for most users.  I would like to offer the user the option to select from a number of fractals
        from a drop-down list or the like.  I also would like to put most of the controls in a dialog box so that that can be shown and
        hidden, instead of the user having to scroll up and down.
    </p>

    <p>
        Finally, I would like to eventually introduce other ways of coloring the plot.

        A deep zoom on the following coordinates rendered this image which would not have been feasible with the previous version: <br />
        Minimum Real Part: -0.15295470977798267<br />
        Maximum Real Part: -0.15286695268191625<br />
        Minimum Imaginary Part: -1.0389919858899233<br />
        Maximum Imaginary Part: -1.0389042287938568<br />
